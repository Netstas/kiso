\

\b Checking for the given string in multiple files.
\b0 \
Syntax:\
grep "string" FILE_PATTERN\
\

\b Use grep recursively
\b0 \
You can search recursively i.e. read all files under each directory for a string "192.168.1.5"\
$ grep -r "192.168.1.5" /etc/\
$ grep -r "green" .\
\

\b Count line when words has been matched
\b0 \
grep can report the number of times that the pattern has been matched for each file using -c (count) option:\
$ grep -c 'word' /path/to/file\

\cf0 $ grep -r -c "green" .\
\
Also note that you can use -n option, which causes grep to precede each line of output with the number of the line in the text file from which it was obtained:\
$ grep -n 'word' /path/to/file\
$ grep -r -n "green" .\
\

\b How do I list just the names of matching files?
\b0 \
Use the -l option to list file name whose contents mention main():\
$ grep -l 'main' *.c\
$ grep -r -l "green" .\
\

\b Show only the matched string
\b0 \
\
By default grep will show the line which matches the given pattern/string, but if you want the grep to show out only the matched string of the pattern then use the -o option.\
\
It might not be that much useful when you give the string straight forward. But it becomes very useful when you give a regex pattern and trying to see what it matches as\
\
$ grep -o "is.*line" demo_file\
is line is the 1st lower case line\
is line\
is is the last line\
\
$ grep -r -o "green" .\
\
\
\
